/*
  Chef is on a solo mission in Chefland, facing N enemies. The strength of the ith enemy is denoted by Aiâ€‹.
Chef starts with an initial strength of H and a resistance level of X.

Here are the rules of the fight:

    If an enemy's strength is less than or equal to Chef's resistance (X), Chef wins without losing any strength.
    If an enemy's strength exceeds Chef's resistance, Chef can still win, but only if his strength is strictly greater than the enemy's.
    In this case, Chef's strength decreases by the enemy's strength after the battle.

Your task is to find the minimum resistance value (X) that Chef needs to defeat all N enemies while ensuring he maintains a 
positive strength after the last battle.
